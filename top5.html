							Lirik is my favourite streamer, he streams everyday 5pm-11pm and later
							if it is a night stream(with <a href=
							"https://www.twitch.tv/giantwaffle">Waffle</a> and <a href=
							"https://www.twitch.tv/shortyyguy">shortyyguy</a>). Sunday is
							"Sub-Sunday" where subscribers can vote on the game for him to play
							next. Lirik plays almost every newly released game and is watched by
							over 45,000 people daily. I like Lirik because he is comical whilst
							still being able to compete at the highest level of play and is highly
							skilled in almost every game he plays. Chat interaction is Lirik's main
							reason why I watch Lirik almost everyday, even though there are more
							than 45,000 people in his chat, he responds and answers questions and
							comments throughout the stream.

							Jaryd Lazar "Summit1G" (Half Hungarian) originally started streaming
							Counter Strike in the early days. Once WarZ (aka 'Infestation: Survivor

							The Bob Ross twitch stream is a highlight of my week, one of the best
							streams on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/" title="Twitch">Twitch</a>.
							Every Monday night, the stream shows reruns of the classic <i>The Joy of
							Painting</i> which on average is viewed by 45,000 people a week. As part
							of the launch of <a href=
							"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative/all" title=

							<i>The Joy of Painting</i> series which started on October 29, 2015 in
							commemoration of what would have been his 73rd birthday. Twitch reported
							that 5.6 million viewers watched the marathon, and due to its
							popularity, created a weekly rebroadcast with one season of <i>The Joy
							of Painting</i> to air on Twitch each Monday, and will have a marathon
							of episodes each October 29th. A portion of the advertising revenue has
							been promised to charities, including <a href="https://www.stjude.org/"

							Let me start off by saying, if GamesDoneQuick streamed everyday - I
							would watch them over any other channel. This being said, GDQ only have
							two events a year which last around 2 weeks each. <a href=
							"https://gamesdonequick.com/" title="GDQ">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>
							and <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/" title="GDQ">Summer Games Done
							Quick</a> are two annual video game speedrun charity marathons held in
							the United States, managed by the communities at <a href=
							"http://speeddemosarchive.com/" title="Speed Demos Archive">Speed Demos
							Archive</a> and <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/" title=
							"Speedruns Live">Speedruns Live</a>. Held since 2010, the events have
							raised money for several charities the most common two being the
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevent_Cancer_Foundation" title=
							"Prevent Cancer Foundation">Prevent Cancer Foundation</a> and <a href=
							"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors_Without_Borders" title=
							"Doctors Without Borders">Doctors Without Borders</a>. The events are
							broadcast live on Twitch. Viewers are encouraged to donate for
							incentives during the stream such as naming characters in a run, having
							the runners attempt more difficult challenges, or winning prizes. Over
							$6.7 million has been raised across thirteen marathons.
