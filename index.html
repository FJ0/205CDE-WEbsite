						Founded in June 2011, Twitch is the world’s leading social video platform and community for gamers.
						Each month, more than 100 million community members gather to watch and talk about video games with 
						more than 1.7 million broadcasters. Twitch’s live and video on demand platform caters to the entire 
						video game industry, including game developers, publishers, media outlets, events, casual content creators, and the entire esports scene.
						
						<h2> <a href="#" rel="bookmark" > Why do people broadcast? </a> </h2>
It’s fun and represents a compelling new social network to connect with friends and fans over a shared love of games. Many broadcasters are making a living on Twitch based solely on how they entertain and interact with their audiences.

<h2> <a href="#" rel="bookmark" > Why are people watching others play video games on Twitch?</a> </h2>
People enjoy watching others who are highly skilled or entertaining when it involves a shared interest. Twitch, however, is much more than a viewing experience; It is live social video that relies on audio and chat to enable broadcasters and their audiences to interact about everything from pop culture to life in general as they game.

						I watch Twitch more than any other type of content. Like many other stream viewers, I cancelled my TV package because I was just not using it after I discovered Twitch around 4 years ago.
						I watch on average 20-25 hours per week, this can go a lot higher depending on events that are on Twitch at the time.
